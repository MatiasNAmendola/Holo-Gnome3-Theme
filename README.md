Based on the excellent work from Tiheum.

This repository helps to have Gnome 3.4 working with this Holo theme.

It doesn't aim to be backward compatible with Gnome 3.2.

Remember that the Holo theme is released under GPLv3 license.
And don't hesitate to share if you modify for your own needs ;).

Et un grand merci à Tiheum pour toutes ses icones/thèmes !
